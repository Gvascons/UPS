# Universal Problem Solver: Architecture Design & Complete Project Specification

## Objective
Create a universal problem-solving system that intelligently routes between two distinct scenarios based on problem characteristics, optimizing for both efficiency and solution quality.

## Core Architecture Philosophy

Design a unified system with two sequential modes based on direct user choice:

### Mode 1: Solution Generation (Always First)
**Create a working solution for any problem**
- Generate initial working code/solution
- Handle data analysis, document creation, API calls, etc.
- Establish baseline performance
- Ensure solution correctness and functionality

### Mode 2: Solution Evolution (User-Requested Enhancement)
**Optimize the working solution to maximum potential**
- Takes the working solution from Mode 1 as input
- Iteratively improves performance through mutations
- Optimizes for specific metrics (accuracy, speed, efficiency)
- Explores solution space for better alternatives
- Perfect for Kaggle-style competitions and optimization challenges

**Simple User Choice:**
- **"Generate a solution"** → Mode 1 only (fast, working solution)
- **"Evolve a solution"** → Mode 1 + Mode 2 (working solution + evolutionary optimization)

## **IX. Implementation Guidelines**

1. **Start Simple:** Build basic routing and direct execution first
2. **Iterate Quickly:** Test with real problems early and often
3. **Monitor Performance:** Track both speed and quality metrics
4. **Learn Continuously:** Use feedback to improve classification and strategies
5. **Scale Gradually:** Add complexity only when core system is stable

This architecture provides a robust foundation for handling both straightforward tasks efficiently and complex optimization problems comprehensively, adapting its approach based on the nature of each unique problem.
